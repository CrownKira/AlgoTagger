## AlgoTagger - LeetCode Question Multilabel Classifier
AlgoTagger is a multilabel classification system designed to categorize LeetCode questions based on the data structures and algorithms they involve. The system takes in the question text as input and outputs a set of relevant labels, each corresponding to a specific data structure or algorithm. AlgoTagger utilizes machine learning techniques and natural language processing to analyze the text and make accurate predictions.

## Features
AlgoTagger features state-of-the-art machine learning models such as Distilbert and XGBoost to accurately predict the relevant data structures and algorithms for each LeetCode question.
